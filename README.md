# Intro/Overview

## Self Introduction by Teacher

My name is Axel Roffi, and I am a blockchain consultant who specializes in the Bitcoin and Tezos blockchains. I have been interested in the blockchain industry since 2013, and I have been into the development of the Tezos protocol since its inception in 2017.

## What we will Cover in This course

This course is designed for beginner to intermediate learners interested in smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain. We will cover the basics of Tezos, including how it operates, what a blockchain is, how blocks are produced, and the key components of the Tezos blockchain. We will show you how to download a Tezos wallet and add some “fake” funds into it. We will then move on to best practices for writing smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain and finally deploy them. Additionally, we will explore NFTs and their applications and write some basic DeFi contracts.

To accomplish this, we will use [SmartPy IDE](https://preview.smartpy.io/0.17.0-beta-02/docs/), an online python-syntax software that allows us to write and deploy smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain.

## How the course will be structured

This is a course that requires some effort from the learners as it is exercised based tutorial. The way it is structured is as follow: for each new concept, we will have an example and then there will be some exercice and practice with some code.

## **Prerequisites for this Course**

- Basic programming skills

You **do not** need:

- Python knowledge - it is helpful but not required
- Prior blockchain experience
